# 🌐 ReactVerse – The Open API Playground

**ReactVerse** is an open-source API dashboard built with **React + Vite**, designed to help developers explore, visualize, and learn how to integrate public APIs safely and responsibly.
It’s more than just a project — it’s a **community-driven learning space** for understanding how APIs work, managing data securely, and contributing meaningfully to open source.

Perfect for **Hacktoberfest**, **beginners**, and **API enthusiasts** who want to get hands-on experience using real-world APIs.
